How to raise the MR: 
check the info in the branch.txt file 
1. point to the develop branch 
2. create a new Branch from develop with the name CMT-"commit Number" eg: CMT-3 
3. do the required changes on the files 
4. commit the changes and push the changes to the develop branch
5. Create the Merge Request and wait for it to be merged.
6. once the MR is merged to the develop branch delete the source branch 
7. also to have a track of the branches we are working on I have created the file name Branch Details.
8. update the file with the last Commit number eg: CMT-3
